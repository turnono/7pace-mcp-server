```
"Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm thrilled to share 7pace MCP with you today!

THE PROBLEM I SOLVED:
As a developer, I was losing 2+ hours daily to context switching between coding and time tracking. Every time I stopped to log hours, I lost focus and productivity.

THE SOLUTION:
7pace MCP integrates AI-powered time tracking directly into Claude AI. Instead of forms and dropdowns, you just have a conversation:

"Log 2.5 hours on work item 1234 for database optimization" → ✅ Done

THE RESULTS:
• 87% reduction in tracking friction
• 34% increase in accuracy
• Zero context switching
• Real-time Azure DevOps sync

This represents a fundamental shift from tools that make us think like computers to tools that understand how humans actually think and work.

WHAT'S NEXT:
• Slack integration for team-wide adoption
• Smart suggestions based on git activity
• Advanced analytics and insights
• Enterprise features for larger teams

Try it now: npx -y github:turnono/7pace-mcp-server

Your feedback will shape the roadmap - what would you build next? 🚀

#TimeTracking #AI #Developer #Productivity #MCP"
```

#### **Follow-up Comments (Throughout the day)**

```
Hour 2 Update:
"Wow! The response has been incredible - thank you all! 🙏 Already seeing feature requests and partnership inquiries. This community is amazing!"

Hour 6 Update:
"Halfway through the day and blown away by the feedback! Top feature requests so far: Slack integration, mobile companion, and multi-platform support. All noted! 📝"

Hour 12 Update:
"12 hours in and still going strong! Special thanks to everyone sharing their time tracking horror stories - this is exactly why we built this. The future is conversational! 🗣️"

Final Hour:
"Final hour and what a journey! Whether we finish #1 or #10, this community has already made 7pace MCP better. Thank you for believing in the vision of invisible productivity tools! 🚀"
