### **Social Media Launch Thread**

```
ðŸ§µ THREAD: We just solved the $23B developer productivity problem

That's it. No forms, no switching, no broken flow.

âœ¨ Integrates directly with Claude AI
ðŸ”„ Real-time Azure DevOps sync
ðŸ§  Smart activity type resolution
ðŸ“Š Natural language reporting

4/8 Early results from beta teams:
â€¢ 87% reduction in tracking friction
â€¢ 34% increase in accuracy
â€¢ 23 minutes saved per developer daily
â€¢ 95% user satisfaction rate

5/8 This isn't just another productivity tool.

It's a fundamental shift toward conversational interfaces that adapt to humans instead of making us adapt to them.

6/8 The age of disruptive productivity tools is over.
The age of invisible productivity tools has begun.

7/8 Want to join the revolution?
